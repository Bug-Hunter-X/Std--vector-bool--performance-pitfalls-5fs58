# std::vector<bool> Performance Pitfalls
This repository demonstrates a common performance issue related to using `std::vector<bool>` in C++.  `std::vector<bool>` is optimized for memory efficiency, but this optimization can lead to slower access times compared to a `std::vector<int>` or `std::vector<char>`. 

## The Problem
The code in `bug.cpp` shows how accessing elements in `std::vector<bool>` can be surprisingly slow. The memory optimization techniques used by `std::vector<bool>` can negatively impact access performance, making it less efficient than a regular vector of boolean values would typically be. 

## The Solution
The solution in `bugSolution.cpp` provides two potential alternatives:

1.  Use `std::vector<char>` (or another primitive type) instead of `std::vector<bool>`. If memory efficiency is not the primary concern, this provides a substantial performance improvement.
2.  If memory usage is indeed critical, consider using a more specialized data structure designed for space efficiency, like bitset or something similar that explicitly supports efficient manipulation of bits. 

The solution demonstrates that choosing the correct data structure is paramount to ensure the performance and efficiency of your C++ programs.  In many cases, the slight overhead of other types is far less significant than the slower access times associated with `std::vector<bool>`.
